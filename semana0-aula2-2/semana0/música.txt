Spiderman, Spiderman!
Does whatever a spider he can.
Spins a web any size,
Catches thieves, just like flies.
Look out! Here comes the Spiderman!
Is he strong? Listen, Bud!
He's got radioactive blood.
Can he swing from a thread?
Take a look overhead.
Hey there, there goes the Spiderman!
In the chill of night,
At the scene of the crime
Like a streak of light
He arrives just in time
Spiderman, Spiderman
Friendly neighborhood Spiderman
Wealth and fame he's ignored
Action is his reward
To him, life is a great big bang-up
Wherever there's a hang-up
You'll find the Spiderman!
